# Open Richman Co-pilot (ORC)

ORC is an open-source platform designed for secure and privacy-focused investment portfolio management. Funded by Amanda from Top-Value, ORC operates locally on your machine, ensuring complete user control over data and privacy. It caters to all investment levels and encourages community contributions. 

## Live Website

ORC is live and can be accessed at [https://open-richman-co-pilot.web.app/](https://open-richman-co-pilot.web.app/).

## Features

1. **Select Desired Price Tickers:** You can choose the price tickers you want to follow.
2. **Input Parameters:** Fill up the required input parameters. If any field is empty, input '0'.
3. **Generate Reports:** Generate comprehensive reports based on your inputs.
4. **Secret Key Generation:** For enhanced security, generate a random secret key and store it securely.
5. **Data Export and Import:** Export the encrypted ORC file for future use. You can also import an encrypted file, but make sure to enter your secret key first to ensure data security.
